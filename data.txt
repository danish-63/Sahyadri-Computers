Ultrafast connectivity: Native M.2 support for Lightning-fast storage speeds ASUS Prime 300 Series motherboards provide the solid foundation needed for your first build, plus flexibility to grow with your ambitions. We've melded all the good stuff that's packed into the latest 8th Generation Intel® Core™ processors with essential ASUS design and engineering, so you benefit from industry-leading technologies — including automated system tuning, comprehensive cooling controls, and immersive onboard audio. When you build with an ASUS Prime 300 Series motherboard, you build smart, easy and affordably.  Improved DDR4 stability ASUS OptiMem preserves memory signal integrity by routing traces and vias to the optimal PCB layer, and our T-Topology trace layout ensures time-aligned signaling by balancing trace lengths between memory slots. These enha ncements allow the Prime 300 Series to support a wide range of dual and quad-DIMM memory kits, while providing your rig with the stability it needs to deal with any type of workload - whether you're gaming or running intensive applications ASUS OptiMem benefits: Improved memory stability and compatibility Allows lower memory latencies at equivalent voltages Improved memory frequency margin All-round energy efficiency With the Energy Processing Unit (EPU) you'll enjoy system-wide power savings. The EPU automatically optimizes power consumption and maximizessavings with Away mode - a smart setting that creates an extreme energy saving scenario by shutting down unused I/O controllers.Flexible cooling controls Prime 300 Series motherboards offer comprehensive control over system fans, via the included Fan Expert software. Auto-Tuning mode intelligently configures all parameters with a single click.Cooler by design Prime 300 Series features the most comprehensive cooling controls ever, configurable via ASUS Fan Xpert software or the UEFI BIOS. Multiple temperature sources - Each header can be set to monitor and react to up to three thermal sensors. Via Fan Xpert, you can also assign a sensor to monitor the temperature of supported ASUS graphics cards to ensure optimal cooling during GPU- or CPU-intensive workloads. 4-pin PWM/DC fan - Each onboard CHA FAN header supports PWM and DC mode.Media-acclaimed UEFI BIOS The UEFI BIOS is an early waypoint on any PC-building journey, and Prime 300 Series has one of the best in the business. Q-Fan Control Can configure the fan's operating speed manually, or use the easy pre-configured fan profiles to select Standard, Silent, Turbo or Full Speed modes, plus automatic switch to full speed if the temperature hits 75°C.Search Function When you're ready for a deeper dive, Advanced mode enables full control over every aspect of the motherboard — with a built-in Search function to find the setting you need in the blink of an eye.USB 3.1 Gen 1 front-panel connector Future-proof connectivity USB 3.1 Gen 1 is right where you need it, with two super-speed headers for the front panel.
